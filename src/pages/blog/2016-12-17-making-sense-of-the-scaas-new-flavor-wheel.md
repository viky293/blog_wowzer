As the full form goes Application Programming Interface, it suggests that we are trying to communicate with something. In order to do so we define certain contracts, which in simpler words is to define the rules of how you ask for something and how I will be responding back to you.

One of the analogies is whenever we write a letter it should have a specific format for specific use cases then, you send it to an address and can also direct to someone very specific in that address. We expect a familiar pattern response.

In case of programming and specially in web it’s like writing a letter to a server, although it’s lightning fast.
