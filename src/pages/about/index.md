### Philosophy

* What makes a good Engineer?

  > One who is not shy of technical breadth and has ability to go in depth when needed
* What's the purpose of life?

  > Here I stick with what [Swami Vivekananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda) said about it. Life in itself does not have any meaning, but its an opportunity to create one.
* What's more important question?

  > To me answering "Why" is foremost. To me asking the question "Should we do it?" is more important question than "Can we do it?"
* What do I think about AI (Artificial Intelligence)

  > A lot of advancements in AI are very fascinating, it does look like a replacement tech, where humans may look like a friction. I don't think there is any specific neeed to make AI that mimics humans. 
  >
  > While
  > "As a human being, I am still learning". 

### Things I want to do

* Travel across the world
* Click more pictures
* Share my knowledge and experiences

### Bit of nostalgia

As a kid computers were always fascinating to me, gradually I found my interest in coding and programming. I love to write code and experiment with new stuff in my spare time.

I have written games, viruses and graphical programs in GW-BASIC, C/C++ & a few Visual Basic 6.0 applications. I have been learning about web development since 2007.

It was when I along with my friend Pragith Prakash won a prize in technical presentation on Web 2.0, I discovered that web is far more interesting than the languages I have known so far. In 2007 I made my first website during college days, later I focused towards development of SAAS based applications and mobile app development.

Now a days I spend my most of the time around web & hybrid mobile application development, have few listed on play store as well.

### Gratitude

Journey started way back in 2000, when I got my Zenith PC with 64MB RAM and 20GB hard-disk, it was like a dream come true.

Thank You! Dad for a gift which made me an Engineer today.
