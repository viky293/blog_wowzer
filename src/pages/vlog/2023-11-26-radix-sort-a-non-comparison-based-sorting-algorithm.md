Radix sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that is similar to count sort. It has a linear time complexity and can be used to sort any type of data, including integers, strings, and floating-point numbers.

Some of the key takeaways from the video:

- Radix sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm. 
- Radix sort has a linear time complexity.
- Radix sort can be used to sort any type of data.
- Radix sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm.
- Radix sort is a stable sort, that mean the order or equal elements is preserved. 

The time complexity of radix sort is O(n * k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of digits in the largest number. This means that the time complexity of radix sort is linear in the number of elements in the array and the number of digits in the largest number.
